# S.T.A.R GUIDE

## SPACE
Describe the obstacles you or your team must overcome to complete your project. "I" should not be used in the space area. Instead, address the Space from a factual, omnipresent perspective that emphasizes the larger picture. Avoid using "we" either. Simply relinquish control and talk about the task or difficulty as if it were alive and had a mind of its own.Â Sharing the who, what, where, and when in this situation is useful.

## TRACK
Follows the S.M.A.R.T. Goal approach to give a specific and measurable visualization of the trajectory that the Project STAR is on. The track is easily visualized as a path through time and space that outlines the past, present, and future of the project.

## ASSIST
Explain what you are going to do to assist the STAR in staying on course and achieving the desired path. Be specific and explain how your time will be spent to overcome the challenge or shift the direction of the project. Even if it is a team effort, lead with "I" instead of "we" to detail your individual approach.

## REACH
Include a confident and predictable final result as an outcome of your efforts to summarize the effects of your actions. Additionally, you may discuss what you've learned, offer perspectives you might use to overcome problems in the future, and describe the measurements (facts, figures, and numbers) used to measure the project's reach.
## SPACE:
The SPACE defines where the specific sits inside its business solar system. This helps us properly map the STAR and to create accurate prediction models. We also define competitors in the Space, our subsidiares which may share resources, and any other element which may affect the ecosystem here.

## TRACK:
The TRACK should be easily visualized as a path through time and space where you discuss the past, present, and future of the trajected path for which the Project STAR is on course. This can be articulated through Roadmapping, Product Journeys, and other business tools to accurately describe a tangible schedule for the STAR. Paint a picture that clearly shows you comprehend where the STAR was before you came and outline a predictable path it will follow.  You may also discuss where you think it is headed in the future.

## ASSIST:
The assist is the module of the STAR that allows for integration. In order to interact properly with the STAR, we must know what capabilities it offers for integration, what assistance it can accept, and what methodologies are allowed.  If the STAR is software-based, this is usually in the form of an API.  If it is a business, it might have an affiliate program or partner program that allows for assisting. We must identify this section or build this section if we own the STAR so it can accept input.  During the Assist is where we expect the individual or teams to perform various operations and manuevers to provide guidance to the STAR.  This can come in the form of DevOps, MLOps, DROID Ops, or other Operational frameworks to manipulate STARs.

## REACH:
Finally, summarize the projected path of the STAR and the vision of how it will head towards a Super Nova event. What new capabilities will it have after a proper assist manuever is performed?  How will this affect the entire Universe it is within? Provide universal context on the end goal achieved or desired here. If possible, talk about facts, figures and stats that quantify the Project Reach. You can also discuss what you learned and share insights that you can
